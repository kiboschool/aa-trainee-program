# Motivation: Why data visualization?

Data visualization is a vital part of the business intelligence process that offers several benefits to businesses and stakeholders. It presents complex data in a visual format, making it easier to understand and identify trends and patterns. This helps businesses to make informed decisions, save time and resources, and communicate insights to stakeholders in a more engaging way. In summary, data visualization is an essential tool for businesses to optimize their operations and make data-driven decisions.

At Kibo, we have a few dashboards targeted to different stakeholders that give a snapshot into the academic performance and engagement of students. For example, course instructors have following dashboards:

- **Attendance dashboard:** to understand the rate at which students attend the weekly meetings.
- **Assignments dashboard:** to see students who are missing assignments and the overall grade distribution for the class.
- **Class feedback:** to understand what the most important things students learned in the week and how they feel about the course.

These dashboards serve as important tools in ensuring students' success and monitor the overall health of the courses.
