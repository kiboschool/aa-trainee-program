# Introduction to Glide

Glide is a platform that allows users to create mobile apps without any coding or programming knowledge. It is a no-code app builder that uses Google Sheets as one of its backend database services, making it easy to create apps that are connected to data sources. 

Glide simplifies the app-building process by providing customizable templates and drag-and-drop components, making it easy to add features such as forms, user authentication, and more. With Glide, you can create apps that are optimized for mobile devices and can be shared with others via a link or QR code. Glide is a powerful tool that can help you bring your ideas to life in minutes.

As an Automation Assistant, one of your primary responsibilities is to build systems and processes that help businesses streamline their operations. While database, survey, and automation tools are essential for this task, connecting data to front-end platforms such as Glide, WeWeb, or Bubble etc. is equally important.
