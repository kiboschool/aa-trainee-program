# Task 1: Streaming Video Subscriptions

## Overview

Summit E-commerce Ventures wants an Operations and Customer Communication System and they have contacted you with the following details:

**Project Overview:**

We want to create an Operations and Customer Communications System using low-code/no-code tools for our e-commerce store. The goal of this system is to streamline our inventory tracking, product management, order processing and fulfillment, and effective communications with customers. We want to ensure real-time visibility into our stock levels and enhance our overall customer experience.

**Overview of our current process:**

When new orders are received or when we restock products, we update the inventory records in our books to capture these changes and keep our inventory accurate.
To prevent overselling a product, when orders are placed for the product, we set aside the quantity ordered as a reservation.

We carry out an hourly check routine to see if any orders have been placed and a daily routine to check the inventory levels of each product, so that we do not run out of products and place orders to the suppliers when the levels are critically low.

During the hourly routine checks, when new orders are received, a dedicated member of staff sends an order confirmation email with all necessary details about the order; including items ordered, quantities, prices, shipping address, and any applicable taxes or fees, to the customer who ordered to let them know that the order has been received and is being processed. Finally, an email is sent when the order has been shipped.
We need your help streamlining this process to make us work better and more efficiently.

<!-- ## Grading

Grading criteria so that students know what is expected of them.  A rubric
is ideal and will make grading the assignment go more quickly. 

This is an example rubric for a into programming course.

| Criteria                            | Proficient                                        | Competent                                          | Developing                                       |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Coding Style (20%)**              |                                                   |                                                    |                                                  |
| 1. Indentation and Formatting       | Code is consistently well-indented and follows PEP 8 formatting guidelines. | Code is mostly well-indented and follows PEP 8 guidelines with minor deviations. | Code lacks consistent indentation and does not follow PEP 8 guidelines. |
| 2. Naming Conventions               | Meaningful and consistent variable/function/class names following PEP 8 conventions. | Mostly meaningful names, with occasional inconsistencies. | Variable/function/class names are unclear or inconsistent. |
| 3. Comments and Documentation       | Comprehensive comments and clear documentation for major functions and complex logic. | Adequate comments explaining major sections of code. | Lack of comments or insufficient documentation. |
| 4. Appropriate Use of Language Constructs | Demonstrates advanced understanding and appropriate use of Python language constructs (e.g., list comprehensions, generators). | Generally applies language constructs correctly, with occasional lapses. | Misuses or misunderstands key language constructs. |
| **Persistence (50%)**               |                                                   |                                                    |                                                  |
| 5. Completeness                     | Evidence that all components of the assignment were attempted.  All functionality present. | Evidence that most elements of the assignment were attempted. Most functionality present. | Little evidence of completion of work.  Incomplete or major functionality missing.        |
| 6. Timeliness                       | Assignment started early (based on GitHub data).  GitHub commits show steady progress. Submitted on time. | Assignment is submitted late but GitHub data demonstrates an early or reasonable start date, with significant iteration on arrival to solution (i.e., multiple commits showing progress) | Submitted late. GitHub repository data shows late start and minimal iteration. |
| 7. Use of Resources                 | Assignment is fully complete and provides all functionality. If assignment is not fully complete, student attended office hours (or additional help sessions) and/or asked high quality and timely questions on Discord. | Assignment is not fully complete and there is minor evidence of effort to get assistance on assignment (e.g., office hours attendance or Discord discussions). | Assignment is incomplete and no evidence of seeking assistance. |
| **Correctness (30%)**               |                                                   |                                                    |                                                  |
| 8. Test Cases                       | Percentage of automated test cases that pass. |||

> **Evidence of Persistence:**
>
> In the event that you are unable to get your program fully functional, you
> will receive partial credit based on your evidence showing the amount of
> effort that went into learning the underlying concepts to complete the
> assignment or that you persistently sought appropriate assistance. Examples of
> persistence may include, but is not limited to, the following: Git commit
> history showing evolution of your program, attendance to office hours
> (Instructor or TA), asking thoughtful questions in the appropriate Discord
> forums, formation of study groups, completion of additional practice
> exercises, reading of third-party resources, etc.  
>
> To receive partial credit, you **must** create a file called `PERSISTENCE.md`
> in your GitHub repo alongside the `README.md` file, and include your evidence
> of persistence, for example, links to your Discord questions, narrative
> explaining dates and times of office hour sessions that you attended and what
> you learned, links to resources that you referenced, links to ChatGPT
> conversations that you initiated (focusing on concepts not just getting
> answers), etc. The better you can demonstrate your work on learning, the
> easier it will be to provide partial credit, so be thorough. Make sure that
> file is properly committed to your repo, and included in your Gradescope
> submission.

## Submitting Your Work

Your work must be submitted Anchor for degree credit and to Gradescope for
grading.

**For coding tasks involving Github Classroom:**

1. Ensure that you `commit` and `push` your local code changes to your remote
   repository.  (Note: In general, you should commit and push frequently, so
   that you have a backup of your work, so that there is evidence that you did
   your own work, and so that you can return to a previous state easily.)
2. Upload your submission to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com) via the
   appropriate submission link by selecting the correct GitHub repository from
   the drop-down list.
3. Export a zip archive of your GitHub repository by visiting your repo on
   [GitHub](https://www.github.com), clicking on the green `Code` button, and
   selecting "Download Zip".
4. Upload the zip file of your repository to Anchor using the form below.

**For cases where you answer questions on Gradescope:**

1. Complete the work in [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com) by navigating
   tot he appropriate link.
2. Export it as a pdf using th Google Chrome plugin:
   [https://gofullpage.com/](https://gofullpage.com/).  This plugin will do
   multiple screen captures while scrolling through your document, and then
   stitch them into a pdf that you can download.
3. Upload the generated pdf to Anchor using the form below.

**For any work completed outside of GitHub or Gradescope:**

1. Take either screen captures of your work or export a pdf showing your
   complete work.
2. Submit the materials to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com) via the
   appropriate submission link for the course.
3. Upload the screen captures or pdf files to Anchor using the form below.

> **Note:** Anchor submissions can occur at any time during the term, but it is
> **critical** that you upload all of your work to Anchor before the last day of
> the term.  Gradescope submissions must be submitted before the deadline (or
> the late deadline, if applicable). -->
