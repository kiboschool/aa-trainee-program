# Google Forms
 
Google Forms is one of the most reliable and versatile tools available for data collection. With its user-friendly interface and robust features, Google Forms makes it easy to create customizable surveys, quizzes, and feedback forms. Plus, the data collected is automatically organized and stored on Google Sheets, making it easy to analyze and share with others. 

So, whether you're a small business owner or a student conducting research for a project, Google Forms is a powerful tool for collecting data and gaining valuable insights.

At Kibo, we use Google forms internally for surveys, course feedbacks, lead generation, and other administrative tasks. By using Google Forms, we are able to gather valuable data from employees, students, and leads in a quick and efficient way.
