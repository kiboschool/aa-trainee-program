# Project Management with Trello

Trello is an example of a Kanban board that can be used for project management. Trello is a popular project management tool that uses a visual approach to project management. Trello's boards, lists, and cards provide a visual representation of the project's progress and status. Each card represents a task or an item that needs to be completed, and the cards can be moved from one list to another as they progress through different stages of completion.
