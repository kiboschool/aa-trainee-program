# Task: Setting Up Your Trello Board

You have all been added to various Google groups, each representing a distinct team; more information about the teams can be found [here](https://lms.kibo.school/course/aatp_aat2/final_project_data_analysis_and_visualization/introduction). An invitation email to your team's Trello workspace has been sent to your email inbox. In the email, click on "Go to Workspace", this will take you to the Trello workspace for this program. Click on Google to login with your Google account - ensure to use email account you applied with.

Once logged in, you will be brought to your team's Trello workspace interface (Watch [this](https://lms.kibo.school/course/aatp_aat2/managing_self/learn_project_management_with_trello) video to understand how to navigate the interface). Here, you should do the following:

1. Create a new board
2. Name it after yourself e.g, _Bidemi Dairo's Board_. If it is a team project, _Team Name: Project Title_.
3. Set the visibility to Workspace
4. On creation, you will be brought to your board with lists; "To Do", "Doing", and "Done" created. Feel free to rename the lists
6. Start tracking your projects with Trello
