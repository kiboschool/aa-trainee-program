# Self Awareness


> 🗣 Self-awareness is the ability to take an honest look at your life without any attachment to it being right or wrong, good or bad.”

## Components of Self-Management
Let’s delve deeper into this definition by exploring three components of self-management: self-awareness, time management, and goal setting.

**Self-Awareness**

To effectively control your thoughts and feelings, you must first recognize them. Thus, self-management starts with _understanding_ your thoughts and feelings. This foundational step is known as self-awareness. 

**Time Management**

To control your behavior, you must regulate how you spend your time. Thus, self-management requires thoughtful time-management. By mastering time management, you can ensure that your actions align with your priorities and goals.

**Goal Setting**

The ultimate purpose of self-management is to achieve your goals. This means having clear, articulated goals that guide your efforts and focus. Without well-defined goals, it’s difficult to channel your energy productively. 

By understanding and applying these three components — self-awareness, time management, and goal setting — you can enhance your ability to manage yourself and achieve your personal and professional objectives. In the lesson on ownerships, you completed a [project](https://lms.kibo.school/course/aatp_aat2/ownership/project_personal_swot) to identify your strengths and weaknesses, and set SMART goals. The lessons in this module will focus on self-awareness and time management, but be sure to review your project if you want a refresher on goal setting. 

First, we begin with a detailed look at self-awareness.


## Self awareness in Action
Self-awareness is the foundation of self-management. Without it, you won't understand your emotions, inclinations, and preferences. Cultivating self-awareness helps you grasp your motivations and the emotions that affect your performance.

Being self-aware means having a clear picture of your thoughts, feelings, values, and motivations. It’s understanding how these elements influence your behavior and decisions.

 **Self-Awareness vs. Self-Consciousness**
Self-awareness is different from self-consciousness. When you are self-aware, you understand more about yourself, your qualities, and your emotions. However, when you are self-conscious, you have undue fixation on your flaws and inabilities. Your goal should be to increase your self-awareness, without increasing your self-consciousness.
