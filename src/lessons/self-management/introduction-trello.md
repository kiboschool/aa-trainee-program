Project management is the process of planning, organizing, and managing resources to achieve specific goals and objectives within a specified timeline. This process involves breaking large projects into subtasks or sub-projects and time planning. 

Large projects can be overwhelming and difficult to manage, but breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks or sub-projects can make them more manageable. This process involves identifying the dependencies between the different parts of the project and creating a timeline for each part. 

Time planning helps ensure that the project is completed on time and within budget, and it also helps identify potential delays or issues that may arise during the project.

## Project management methodologies
These are frameworks that provide a set of guiding principles and processes to manage projects effectively. Some of the most popular project management methodologies include Agile, Waterfall, and Scrum.

1. **Agile methodology** is an iterative approach that involves breaking down a project into small, manageable pieces, and delivering them in short cycles. A popular subset of Agile methodoly is **Kanban**, which uses Kanban boards to visually represent stages of work. 

2. **The Waterfall methodology** is a sequential approach that involves completing each phase of the project before moving on to the next. 

3. **Scrum methodology** is a framework that focuses on delivering value to the customer by breaking down work into small, actionable tasks.

These methodologies provide a set of guiding principles and processes that help teams manage projects effectively.

## Kanban boards
Many teams use project management tools to implement their methodology. Popular project management tools include Trello, Asana, JIRA, Monday, etc. These tools provide a platform for teams to collaborate, communicate, and manage tasks and projects effectively. Most of these tools support the use of Kanban boards. 

Kanban is a methodology that focuses on the flow of work and visualizing the work process. A Kanban board is a visual representation of the work process that includes columns for each stage of the process. Each task or item is represented by a card that is moved from one column to the next as it progresses through the work process. Kanban boards can be used to manage tasks and projects effectively by providing a clear visual representation of the work process and the status of each task.
