# Project: Presentation

In this project, you'll prepare and deliver a 10-minute presentation. 

## Presentation requirements
The presentation should help the audience understand how to build an automation using AirTable, Zapier, and/or any of the automation tools you've encountered so far. The presentation should use one of your projects (e.g., Squad Cup or Employee Time Off) as an example and walk the audience through how to build this automation. At the end of your presentation, the audience should:
- Have a general understanding of the capability of your automation tools (i.e., Airtable or Zapier)
- Understand your project's goals, and how the automations helped accomplish the goal

Your presentation must include an accompanying slide deck with appropriate visuals.
