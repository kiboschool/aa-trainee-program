# Introduction

In the module on "Speaking Wel", we discussed verbal communication skills with a focus on powerful introductions and virtual presence. In this module, we'll focus on another aspect of verbal communication: giving presentations. Whether it's pitching your ideas to teammates or delivering a tech talk at a conference, presenting well is key to career growth. Public speaking and presentation skills enable technical professionals to convey their insights and get buy-in for their ideas. Unlocking opportunities (especially leadership opportunities) requires technical mastery _and_ strong communication skills.
