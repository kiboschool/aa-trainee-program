# How to give effective presentations

<blockquote>
  ‚ÄúThere are two types of speakers: those that are nervous and those that are liars.‚Äù - Mark Twain

In this lesson, we'll focus on two skills that will help you give effective presentations: (1) crafting your message, and (2) delivering with confidence. 

## Crafting your message
As with all communication, delivering a compelling presentation depends on the **message** and the **recepient**. Before diving into flashy slides or captivating delivery, you must first understand who your audience is and decide what the key takeaways of the presentation should be. 

<aside> ü§î Think of the key takeaways as the "so what" of your presentation. What should the audience feel, know, or do after listening to your presentation?

Clarify on the messages you want to deliver, and who the recepients are will provide a strong foundation for your presentation, and help you align your content and structure with your main objectives. 

Once you consider audience and key messages, then it's time to pick a presentation structure.

## Delivering with confidence 
When you're getting ready for a presentation, it's normal to feel nervous, or perhaps even overwhelmed. Depending on your comfort-level with public speaking, your feelings about giving presentations might range from slight nervousness to extreme fear and panic.  In either case, it is possible to deliver presentations with confidence.

Both videos share tips on delivery which can be summarized in three broad areas:

### Practice!
- **Rehearse Out Loud:** Run through your presentation multiple times to to become familiar with the content and flow
- **Record Yourself:** Record yourself practicing and then watch it back. This allows you to identify areas for improvement in body language, vocal variety, and clarity of your message.
- **Give a Mock Presentation:** Give a mock presentation to peers or friends in the similar environment as what you'll do in real life. Practice using the same tool (e.g., zoom or slides) that you will use in the real presentation. Time yourself, and commit to finishing even if you make a mistake.

### Focus on Posture and Physicality (Virtual Presentations)
- **Maintain Eye Contact:** Position your camera at eye level, and look directly into the camera to simulate eye contact with your audience
- **Sit Up Straight:** Sit up straight with your shoulders and back engaged. Good posture projects confidence and helps with voice projection.
- **Control your Movements:** Use deliberate gestures and avoid fidgeting to keep the audience's attention.

### Engage the audience
- **Vary Your Vocal Delivery:** Avoid a monotone voice. Use variations in pace, volume, and pitch to keep your audience engaged and highlight important points.
- **Interactive Questions:** Incorporate questions throughout your presentation to encourage audience participation, even virtually. Utilize chat functions or polling tools to keep them actively involved.
- **Encourage Feedback:** Invite questions and comments during and after the presentation to create a dialogue.
