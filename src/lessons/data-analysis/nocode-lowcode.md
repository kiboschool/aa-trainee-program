# No-code/Low-code Development

## Introduction

If I were asked to build a house from scratch without any prior experience in construction, I would be lost. However, if given a prefabricated kit with pre-cut pieces and instructions, the task would be much more manageable, similar to building with Legos. Instead of manually crafting each component, I could easily assemble pre-designed blocks that fit together seamlessly, allowing me to create complex structures without requiring extensive construction knowledge.

In the same way, low-code and no-code tools are like prefabricated kits for building software applications. With these tools, you can assemble pre-built components and features to create complex software solutions without needing to have extensive programming knowledge or experience. These tools provide a foundation for you to build upon and customize, making it easier for anyone to create software applications without starting from scratch.
