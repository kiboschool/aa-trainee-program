Getting an entry-level job can be tough. Many entry-level jobs require experience and so early job seekers feel like they are caught in a bind: without being given an opportunity to start, how does one gain experience? Situations like this can leave job seekers feeling frustrated and at the mercy of an impossible system. 

> 🤔 So, what’s an entry-level job seeker to do?

One approach to navigating modern career development is to think like an engineer. Whether they are designing new buildings, electrical circuits, or software systems, engineers focus on solving problems. They use their technical knowledge, collaboration skills, and creativity to find solutions to complex problems. Navigating a career is a complex problem. One that calls for “career engineering.”
