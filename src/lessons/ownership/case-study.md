  This is a part-time, remote position and you are expected to work 3 days (24 hours) per week. Your compensation will be 500GBP per month.

Bukola, we are delighted to offer you this contract after your exemplary performance during the 2-month trial work phase.

As you might imagine, Bukola is overjoyed! After a rigorous interview process, including a two-month unpaid trial, she has accomplished her goal of landing a remote job before graduation. 


## Meet the "Also-Rans"

While Bukola celebrates this accomplishment, numerous others are dissapointed. They include:

- Victor, a student at UNILAG, who never even heard back on his initial application
- Emeka, a 500-level Engineering student at UNN is still bemoaning that he was asked to leave the trial program
- Aliko, a recent graduate of Mathematics from Nairoibi was also part of trial but failed to receive an offer

Over the coming months, as we learn and practice essential non-technical, you'll meet Aliko, Emeka, Victor, and many others who did not get the offer. You'll understand the flaws in their approach, and the particular skills and mindsets that set apart the Bukolas of the world. 

Let's go!
