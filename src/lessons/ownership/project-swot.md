### Step 1: Create your personal SWOT analysis

Youâ€™ve already considered your strengths, weaknesses, and purpose. To finish your SWOT analysis, you will need to consider opportunities and threats, as described in the resources above. 

To complete this project, [make a copy of this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MlTCDVotZz7xaHxuh6Kjjkl5U4NLg6HJhhlhiZ7y1Yg/template/preview) and add your SWOT analysis on page 1

### Step 2: Goals

The final step of this project is to set short and long-term goals.
- Your short-term learning goals should describe your goals for the training period. Set concrete goals for what you want to accomplish by the end of the training
- Your short-term career goal should be related to the job or internship you aim to have after completing this training
- Your 5-year career goal should relate to your professional aims within 5 years of completing the training

As you set goals, ensure that your goals are SMART i.e.

- Specific: What do I want to learn?
- Measurable: How will I know you have achieved my goal?
- Attainable:  How will I do it?
- Realistic: How will I do it given my current responsibilities, needs, etc.?
- Time-Bound: When is the deadline to achieve my goal?

Here are some typical goals that a computer science student might set. For each goal, you will see a non-SMART version and a SMART version.
