## Key differences between Airtable and Spreadsheets (Google Sheets)

- **Database-like Functionality:** Airtable and Google Sheets differ in their approach to data management. While Google Sheets is primarily focused on providing spreadsheet functionality, Airtable takes a more database-like approach. Airtable allows users to create relationships between tables and link records, which can result in a more structured and organized database experience. In contrast, Google Sheets lacks the same level of record linking and relationship management capabilities.

- **Customizable Views:** Airtable is known for its diverse range of customizable views, which includes grid, calendar, gallery, and kanban views. These views provide users with the ability to visualize and interact with their data in multiple ways, and can be customized to suit individual needs. This results in a flexible and dynamic experience for users. Conversely, Google Sheets mainly offers a traditional grid view, which can limit the visualization options available to users.

- **Integration and Automation:** Airtable offers seemless integration with several third-party services and platforms, which enables users to automate workflows and streamline processes. Airtable's built-in automation capabilities allow users to set up triggers and actions that initiate automated tasks based on specific events or conditions. In contrast, although Google Sheets also provides integration capabilities, its automation features do not match the extent of Airtable's.

- **Advanced Collaboration Features:** Airtable provides advanced collaboration capabilities such as real-time collaboration, commenting, and activity logs. These features enable several users to work on the same base concurrently, leave comments for discussion and feedback, and track changes made to the data. Although Google Sheets also supports real-time collaboration, Airtable offers extra collaboration features that enhance team collaboration and communication.
