# Advisor Check-in Automation

## Project Details

After each class, students are expected to complete a form, responding to a series of questions regarding their class experience. These questions include:

- Overall impression of the class.
- The most significant takeaway from the class.
- Their current learning state, categorized into three zones: Comfort, Learning, or Panic.
- An option to express their willingness to be contacted by an advisor by providing their email.

Each student is assigned to a student advisor, and this information is managed in an Airtable database.

Your task is to create a workflow to facilitate communication between students and advisors. The workflow should:
- Take a response from a Google Form.
- Check if the response has an email address – indicating that the student is interested in speaking with their advisor.
- Send an email notification to the student's advisor of the student’s desire to speak with them.

## Resources

- Make a copy of [this sample data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pMK1S1K4aXnoMYkWlz3s19KAIXMBQWUR3bAPeO9Wov0/copy) which includes details about students and their advisors (All fake names and email addresses).

- To confirm your emails are sending, you may want to update one of the advisors emails to your email.

**Deliverables**

- A link to a video explaining how your implementation works, and showing the workflow from a student filling out the form -- with and without indicating a need to speak with their advisor, and an advisor getting notified.

- A google docs writeup documenting the technical design of the base. This writeup should help another member of the team understand how the base is built, and how to make improvements.
