<aside>

‚ùì Select **one** criterion from the above checklist, and use it to evaluate the writing examples below. 

You can comment on something that the writer does well or something that the writer could improve to increase the effectiveness of their message. You can use the same criterion for all four essays or pick a new one for each essay. All these essays are responses to the question: "Why are you applying to this writing course, and what do you hope to gain from participating?"

### Written Communication Examples

    <summary> Example 1 </summary>

To know how to deliver messages clearly so as to stop the room for misunderstanding or alteration of messages, to learn how to solve the situation in a respectful manner, to know how to bridge the gap between individuals and groups through the flow of information and understanding between them and to learn how to provide good recommendations and suggestions especially when making decisions.

And hope to gain communications skills such as writing, listening, speaking and sign languages skills, create better relationships between individuals and groups and how to deliver messages clearly, also I hope to gain how to chair meetings in communication for success

<details>
    <summary> Example 2 </summary>

I am an accounting graduate and throughout my studies l never focused on communication skills assuming that all my communication will be through balance sheets etc. However to be a great accountant you need to be able to write reports that clearly explain what your financial reports mean to non accountants so opportunities are always offered to those with some communication skill as they are better able to produce quality reports. With this course l hope to first revamp my CV and present myself in the best light, improve my overal communication skills and be more marketable on the job market.
</details>

<details>
    <summary> Example 3 </summary>

Communication is essential in our living and daily activities, and must be prioritized. 

Am applying because communication is part of human race and needs to be done well and in a right way, what I stand to gain is the required knowledge and skills in communication and impact generations, and promote businesses since it is fundamental in business world.
</details>

<details>
    <summary> Example 4 </summary>

As rightly said by James Humes, "The art of communication is the language of leadership", I strongly believe that, for me to make a difference in today's world as an upcoming Data Scientist, I need to learn how to communicate my findings, insights and thought appropriately. I believe, Communication For Success has all the required tools and resources to train to become a good communicator.

Again, Communication For Success presents a structured environment where I can consistently improve on my communication skills.

I hope to build my knowledge and skills in communicating appropriately as I improve to lead people in the Tech space.
