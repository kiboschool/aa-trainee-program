# Project: Technical Blog Post

In this project, you will write a technical blog post. Your post should be a "how to" on any technical topic (e.g., how to build an app using Google Sheets and Glide.) Assume the audience of the blog post has basic technical proficiency. 

Your blog post should:
- Be 1000 - 1500 words
- Persuade, i.e., convey information and convince the reader to use your tool
- Inform, i.e., provide the reader with helpful knowledge and insight
- Instruct, i.e., teach the reader how to do something or provide them with the information they need to complete a task
