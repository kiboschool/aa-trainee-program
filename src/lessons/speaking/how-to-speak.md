# How to Speak Well

Speaking is the process of communicating through spoken language. It involves using one's voice to convey a message to an audience, typically in the form of words and sentences. But, **speaking is more than just saying words.** Speaking well requires considering the needs of the audience, choosing the right words and tone of voice, and organizing the message in a clear and logical way. There are three important components of speaking well:

1. The words that you use. (The verbal message)
2. How you say those words. (Vocalics = The vocal nonverbal message)
3. Your body language and other nonvocal nonverbal cues.

Let us explore each of the three aspects of speaking introduced above so that you can feel more confident in achieving your speaking goal of **ensuring your message is accurately heard, understood, and acted upon.**

## Your Words (The verbal message)

When you are speaking with other people, you should know what you want to accomplish (i.e., your purpose) and to whom you are speaking to (i.e., your audience). Ensure the words you select will be understood by your audience and serve your purpose. As with writing, selecting the correct level of formality is important. Ensure you use the appropriate level of formality based on the purpose, audience, and context of your spoken interaction.

## How you speak (Vocalics = The vocal nonverbal message)

While words are an important part of speaking, they account for less than 10% of the meaning that people attribute to our message. Vocalics (the vocal but nonverbal message) account for around 40% of the meaning, and body language and other nonvocal nonverbal cues account for over 50% of the meaning that is made.
