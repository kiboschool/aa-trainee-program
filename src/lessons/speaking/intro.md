The tweet above was shared by Mark Essien, the founder of Hotels.ng and the HNG internship program, which has engaged tens of thousands of Africans in learning tech. While the tweet represents one person's opinion and may not be true of all Nigerians or all Africans, it underscores an important message: **speaking well matters, especially in the context of remote work and collaboration.**  And speaking well is not only about choosing the right words. Ensuring your spoken communication has the intended impact requires delivering those words in the appropriate virtual environment, using appropriate tone, and order.
