# Mastering Your Virtual Presence

Remote work offers access to a broader job market and the ability to work from anywhere. However, it also presents unique challenges when it comes to speaking well. While face-to-face interactions allow for non-verbal cues and a more natural flow of communication, virtual settings require a more intentional approach.  By mastering your virtual presence, you can overcome these challenges, stand out to potential employers, and thrive in remote work. 

## Crafting your virtual work environment

A professional virtual environment is crucial. It will shape how employers, colleagues and clients perceive you. Imagine a cluttered desk or inappropriate attire in a physical meeting â€“ a messy virtual background or unclear audio has the same negative impact. A well-organized, distraction-free space signals professionalism, respect, and readiness. 

#### Tips for creating a professional virtual work environment

- Lighting: Ensure your face is well-lit using natural light or a dedicated light source like a ring light.
- Background: Keep your background clean and uncluttered, or use a virtual background.
- Camera Positioning: Position your camera at eye level to maintain eye contact and enhance engagement.
- Audio Quality: Use a high-quality microphone and minimize background noise to ensure clear communication.
- Dress Code: Dress as you would for an in-person meeting to convey professionalism and confidence.

Creating a professional environment fosters trust and maximizes the chances that your verbal messages will have their intended effect.

## Practice 
1. Choose a topic you've learned so far in the AAT program (e.g., data visualization). Prepare a short (3-minute or less) overview of it, as if you were describing your knowledge to a potential employer
2. Record Yourself: Use your phone's camera or a video conferencing platform to record your presentation.
3. Self-Evaluation: Review your recording. Identify areas for improvement based on the tips discussed in this lesson.
4. Re-record & Reflect: Re-record your presentation, applying the feedback you identified. Reflect on how your virtual presence has improved.

> **Optional**: upload your re-recorded presentation to YouTube (make the video unlisted) and share a link in Slack [here](https://automationass-9vu2026.slack.com/archives/C075JF6LCF3/p1716733325356079).
