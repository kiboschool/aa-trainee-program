# Expectations

This page lists the expectations of you as an Automation Assistant Trainee. It includes action items for you to take on your first day, and each day and week after. 

## Day 1

#### Introduce yourself
Join the program's dedicated [Slack workspace](https://app.slack.com/client/T06TWT7EXAB/C06TWV8PXL7) (an invite has been sent to you), and send a message to the `01-introduction` channel to introduce yourself. The introduction should include:
- Your name and year at the university
- City you are located
- <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/2-truths-lie-idea-list-1-31144">2 truths and a lie </a> (everyone else will try to guess which one is a lie)
- A Gif or image that represents how you're feeling about being an AAT

#### Read program overview
During your first day, you should read through the entire program overview, and start working on Week 1 project. 


## Every Day 

#### Daily Standup
We will begin each day with an async Daily Standup Meeting. Daily Standups are a common part of technical teams. During standup meetings, teams meet briefly (usually less than 15 minutes) to discuss progress and identify blockers. The meeting is called a "stand-up" because it's short (usually less than 15 mins) and everyone stands during it. You can read more about daily standups <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/standups">here.</a>

We will hold the daily stand up asynchronously. Async daily stand-ups are common among distributed teams where team members work from different time zones. Each team member shares their update when they report to work. They also read their colleagues' updates, and identify ways to help. You are required to share a stand-up in the `04-standups` channel each day within the first half hour of starting work. Your standup should answer the following questions:
- What did I work on yesterday?
- What am I working on today?
- What issues are blocking me?
- How am I feeling today (this can be a word, emoji, gif, or something else representing your 'mood')?

> ðŸ“Œ You are required to share a standup in Slack each day that you are working.

#### Daily Check-in and Check-out

At the start of your workday, you are required to check in on the dedicated Slack channel and check out at the end of your workday. You are allowed to check in and check out as many times as necessary throughout the day. It is important to check out at the end of your workday, otherwise the system will assume that you worked for 2 hours that day.

<!-- > ðŸ¤” **Why time-tracking?**
> 
>  Many job contracts are "pay as you go" and  require you to submit a timesheet showing what you worked on. Even if it is not required, tracking your time is good practice because it:
> - Helps you better understand how you are spending your time, and how long various projects take you
> - Gives you support/evidence if you are asked by a client or supervisor to justify how long a task took  -->

## Every Week

#### Weekly team meeting
You will be required to attend a weekly meeting with your trainers and some of your colleagues. Check your calendar for an invitation to your weekly meeting. This is similar to a weekly meeting you might have on a project team in the workplace. 

#### Weekly office hours
We will also have weekly office hours with the trainers. The office hours are an opportunity for you to get feedback, help to unblock you or have your questions or concerns addressed. You will receive calendar invites for the possible office hours you can join.
