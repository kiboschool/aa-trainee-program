# Getting and Giving Help

We are #BetterTogether, and encourage you to seek and offer help where you can. Below is some guidance on asking for and giving help.


## Getting Help
If you are stuck on a problem or have questions about a topic or tool, drop a message in the dedicated [Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T06TWT7EXAB/C06UM180Z2Q). Be sure to:

- Clearly explain the problem and your objectives
- Share the steps you've taken so far

Additional learning materials can be found in the `Additional Resources` section. We are here to assist you, and reaching out ensures a seamless learning journey.

## Giving Help

1. **Encourage Independent Learning:**
   - Rather than giving direct answers, guide your peers to resources,
     references, or methodologies that can help them solve the problem on their
     own. Encourage them to understand the concepts rather than just finding the
     correct solution.  Work through examples that are different from the
     assignments or practice problems provided in the course to demonstrate the
     concepts.

2. **Collaborate, Don't Complete:**
   - Collaborate on ideas and concepts, but avoid completing assignments or
     projects for others. Provide suggestions, share insights, and discuss
     approaches without doing the work for them or showing your work to them.

6. **Be Mindful of Collaboration Tools:**
   - If using collaboration tools like version control systems or shared
     documents, make sure that contributions are clear and well-documented.
     Clearly delineate individual contributions to avoid confusion.

7. **Refer to Resources:**
   - Direct your peers to relevant textbooks, online resources, or
     documentation. Learning to find and use resources is an essential skill,
     and guiding them toward these materials can be immensely helpful both in
     the moment and your career.

8. **Ask Probing Questions:**
   - Instead of providing direct answers, ask questions that guide your peers to
     think critically about the problem. This helps them develop problem-solving
     skills.

10. **Promote Honesty:**
    - Encourage your peers to take pride in their work and to be honest about
      the level of help they received. Acknowledging assistance is a key aspect
      of academic integrity.

Remember, the goal is to create an environment where you can learn from
each other (after all, we are better together) while we develop our individual
skills and understanding of the subject matter.
