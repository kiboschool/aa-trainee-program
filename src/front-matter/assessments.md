# Assessments

You will be learning by doing, and be assessed on your ability to complete individual and team projects.

## Weekly individual projects
Each week, you will complete a project demonstrating your understanding of concepts and tools covered during that week.

## Bi-weekly team projects
Every other week, you will collaborate with your colleagues to complete a project. These projects are larger in scale and will give you the opportunity to solve real-world problems from conception to completion.

## Capstone project
At the end of the training period, you will complete an individual capstone project. This will bring together everything you have been learning, and give you a robust project to add to your portfolio.
